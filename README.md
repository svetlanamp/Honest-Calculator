# Honest-Calculator
Honest Calculator project from Hyperskill course



The project involves building a simple calculator which later on is going to motivate users to try and do the math themselves by becoming more and more honest with them. For example, if they need to do calculations with multidigit numbers, that might be tricky, so the calculator won't be very hard on them and just solve it. However, if the equation is a simple sum of two integers like 2 + 3, maybe it should suggest solving it themselves.

The final result is the implementation of the following flowchart:
